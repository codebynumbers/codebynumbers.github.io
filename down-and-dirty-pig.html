  </div>
  <div class="article_text">
    <p>I've been a fan of <a href="http://mortardata.com/">Mortar</a> for over a year now. Mortar
is a service that allows you to create and run Pig scripts via a web interface.
It also allows you to easily wire up Python/Jython functions that can be called
from your Pig scripts. We love Python at <a href="http://www.50onred.com">50onRed</a> 
and this made our scripts really powerful, allowing us to decode data, 
extract top-level domains and so on.
On top of that they have a <a href="https://github.com/mortardata/pig-json">json parsing library</a>
that is orders of magnitude better than the default one that ships with Pig. 
I was disappointed to learn that the defaul json library treats JSON like a csv,
meaning if you're data schema isn't the same on every line ... you're gonna have a
bad time.</p>
<p>Mortar recently announced an acquistion by Datadog and will be closing up shop. 
Unfortunate yes, but that seems to be the trend of web services recently. This also opened 
up a huge opportunity to build a tool that allows us to continue to work
in a familiar way and learn something about Pig and Amazon EMR along the way.</p>
<p>At the time I started building this tool, I was familiar with a couple of services
that do some things similar to Mortar. I had tried HortonWorks which is distributed as a
self-contained VM, and is actually pretty cool and feature heavy.
I also stumbled on a couple others <a href="http://gethue.com/">Hue</a> and
<a href="http://www.qubole.com/">Qubole</a> while experimenting, neither looked particular inviting.
I didn't want to learn a new tool, I wanted what I had, and more importantly
I wanted to build something for the sake of building something and for the fun of it.</p>
<p>Ok then, what does our tool need? First and foremost, a web app. Flask seems like a good fit, 
even better I have a project I use to bootstrap new apps
<a href="https://github.com/codebynumbers/Flask-Foundation">Flask Foundation</a>. 
And what does the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimum_viable_product">MVP</a> look like?
It needs to have users, user can create pig scripts that reference Python functions,
those jobs can be Illustrated before they are run on a cluster, and finally the scripts
can be run and the results can be accessed.</p>
<p>Not too bad for a feature list. Figured it would take no more than a couple of weekends 
to whip that together and we'd have a tool that emulated the parts of Mortar we used.</p>
<h3>Actual Outcome</h3>
<p>Bootstrapping the Flask app went well, after some initial prototyping I converted the app
over to class-based views using a 50onRed library called <a href="https://bitbucket.org/50onred/fifty/overview">Fifty-Flask</a>.
Created models for Users, Projects, Jobs, saving and reading data, all good stuff.
Then the fun starts, actually running jobs. </p>
<h4>The process flow</h4>
<p>A user creates a project (assuming the script is flawless) and that job script gets stored on S3.
The pig script needs to register a few jars so that magic can happen. 
We'll need a jar for JsonParsing (borrowing the above that Mortar was kind enough to open source). 
We'll need a Jar for running Python scripts (Using the built-in Jython jar, 
after tracking down it's actual location on the latest AMI). We also need to register our Python functions,
so a seperate file for those needs to get pushed to s3 as well.
Now we can submit a job step to an EMR cluster using <a href="http://boto.readthedocs.org/en/latest/">boto</a>.
The cluster gets bootstrapped and our script runs. If all goes well, data gets stored somewhere on S3 and everyone's happy.</p>
<h4>But... usually not</h4>
<p>When writing Pig scripts you are bound to screw something up. Usually it's referencing 
a variable that doesn't exist or trying to overwrite the results of a previous job.
Wouldn't it be cool if our tool could help diagnose that upfront instead of waiting for 
a 10-node cluster to be bootstrapped only to fail minutes after.</p>
<h4>Enter the Illustrator</h4>
<p>Pig has a cool feature called Illustate which essentially takes your script, fetches some data
runs your code and shows you what a few pieces of your data look like at each step.
When it works, it's invaluable. PS. it's not perfect and doesn't always work.</p>
<p>So how could we add Illustration? The first hurdle, we want our illustration results as fast
as possible. We don't want to wait for a 1 node cluster to come up each time we illustrate. 
So ok, long running cluster it is. This is easy to with by setting the keep_alive 
parameter to running a jobflow. So we spin up a cluster, wait for it to become ready, and store
some info about it. When we want to Illustrate, we take our script, remove any "STORE" directives,
tack on an "ILLUSTRATE", push it up, run it and wait for our output to get written to S3.</p>
<h4>Not so fast</h4>
<p>I mean really not fast at all. Once evertthing was wired up. It was taking upwards of 10 minutes
to get illustration results. What I realized after some googling is that the Pig log files
are uploaded back back to S3 in batches, and this can take 5-10 minutes. That's no good. My
solution was to use the <a href="http://www.paramiko.org/">paramiko</a> library to ssh to the box and get the logs
directly and it worked like a charm. But things are still a bit slow. It turns out Illustrate's 
run time is affected by how much input data their is. So if i'm looking a days or month's of
logs, I suspect it build a list of all possible files and samples accordingly. Maybe. I'm not 100%
sure what it's doing that actaully takes forever.</p>
<p>That's not really good enough for a tool we want to use often. So what can be done? 
I suspect there are some optimizations that can be made inside the implementation of
Pig's Illustrate command itself. Ain't nobody got time for that. What can we do? 
Give it less data. If all we care about is that our script looks like it's doing the right thing
and the script doesn't throw an error. Let's just add a step to take our own data samples.
So if we see a log path like s3://somebucket/logs/blah/<em> we'll just list those files ourselves
and rewrite the script to grab one of the files. This works surprisingly well, but has it's own problems
with more complicated matching patterns like s3://somebucket/logs/blah/</em>/stuff/ or
s3://somebucket/logs/blah/{02,03}/*, since the boto S3 library doesn't support file advanced file globbing.
Some of these cases are solved and some are works in progress. But we have something that works most of the time.</p>
<h4>What else</h4>
<p>So that's about it, obviously there's some code that is not yet open-sourced. And I 
had to create a new Pig syntax highlighter for the <a href="http://ace.c9.io/">Ace editor</a>, 
which is probably another post. Oh and it needed a name ... I'll call him Porkins.</p>
